#**Hangman Game in Python**#

Welcome to Hangman, a classic word-guessing game implemented in Python! This game is a command-line interface (CLI) application that challenges players to guess a secret word by suggesting letters one at a time. With each incorrect guess, a part of a stick figure is drawn, and players must guess the word before the stick figure is completely drawn to win.

**Features**

    Displays the current progress of the word with underscores representing unguessed letters.
    Allows players to input guesses for letters in the word.
    Draws parts of a stick figure for each incorrect guess.
    Displays a visual representation of the hangman as the game progresses.
    Provides feedback on the correctness of guesses and alerts players when they have won or lost.
    Option to play again after each game completion.

**How to Play**
